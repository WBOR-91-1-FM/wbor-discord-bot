# wbor-discord-bot: A [Discord] bot for [WBOR]

`wbor-discord-bot` is a simple but powerful [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot that integrates [WBOR](https://wbor.org) into your guild.

This project is a fork of [Azuri](https://github.com/AzuraCast/Azuri), but at this point the only similarity is the command structure.

## TODO
- [x] listen to the station on voice channels;
- [x] show last played tracks, currently playing;
- [ ] update channel status on song changes (only updates when joining the vc);
- [ ] dockerize it
